       "'William Shakespeare (bapt.Tooltip baptised 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world\\'s pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England\\'s national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner (sharer) of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain\\'s Men, later known as the King\\'s Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare\\'s private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.\\nMany of Shakespeare\\'s plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare\\'s, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare\\'s dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: \"not of an age, but for all time\".'"

Down the Rabbit-Hole      Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the  bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into  the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or  conversations in it, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand what is the use of a book,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwithout pictures or conversations?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the  hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of  making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and  picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran  close by her.    There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it  so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh  dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (when she thought it over afterwards,  it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the  time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a  watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried  on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she  had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a  watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a  large rabbit-hole under the hedge.    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how  in the world she was to get out again.    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then  dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think  about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very  deep well.    Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had  plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what  was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out  what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she  looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with  cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures  hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she  passed; it was labelled Ã¢\\x80\\x9cORANGE MARMALADEÃ¢\\x80\\x9d, but to her great  disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear  of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the  cupboards as she fell past it.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cafter such a fall as this, I shall  think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll all think me  at home! Why, I wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t say anything about it, even if I fell off the  top of the house!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (Which was very likely true.)    Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder how  many miles IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve fallen by this time?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said aloud. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must be  getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would  be four thousand miles down, I thinkÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (for, you see, Alice had learnt  several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and  though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her  knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good  practice to say it over) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94yes, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s about the right distanceÃ¢\\x80\\x94but  then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (Alice had no  idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice  grand words to say.)    Presently she began again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder if I shall fall right _through_  the earth! How funny itÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll seem to come out among the people that walk  with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (she was rather  glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t sound at all  the right word) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94but I shall have to ask them what the name of the  country is, you know. Please, MaÃ¢\\x80\\x99am, is this New Zealand or Australia?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  (and she tried to curtsey as she spokeÃ¢\\x80\\x94fancy _curtseying_ as youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re  falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what  an ignorant little girl sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll think me for asking! No, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll never do  to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began  talking again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDinahÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  (Dinah was the cat.) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI hope theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll remember her saucer of milk at  tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are  no mice in the air, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And here  Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a  dreamy sort of way, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and  sometimes, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo bats eat cats?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d for, you see, as she couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t answer  either question, it didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t much matter which way she put it. She felt  that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was  walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d when suddenly,  thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and  the fall was over.    Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another  long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down  it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,  and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh my ears  and whiskers, how late itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s getting!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She was close behind it when she  turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging  from the roof.    There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when  Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every  door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to  get out again.    Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid  glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;  but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,  but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second  time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and  behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the  little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!    Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not  much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the  passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get  out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright  flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head  through the doorway; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand even if my head would go through,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought  poor Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,  how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only  knew how to begin.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had  happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things  indeed were really impossible.    There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went  back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at  any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this  time she found a little bottle on it, (Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhich certainly was not here  before,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper  label, with the words Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDRINK ME,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d beautifully printed on it in large  letters.    It was all very well to say Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDrink me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but the wise little Alice was  not going to do _that_ in a hurry. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll look first,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand see whether itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s marked Ã¢\\x80\\x98_poison_Ã¢\\x80\\x99 or notÃ¢\\x80\\x9d; for she had read  several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and  eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they  _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;  and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually  bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a  bottle marked Ã¢\\x80\\x9cpoison,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d it is almost certain to disagree with you,  sooner or later.    However, this bottle was _not_ marked Ã¢\\x80\\x9cpoison,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d so Alice ventured to  taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed  flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and  hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.    *      *      *      *      *      *      *        *      *      *      *      *      *    *      *      *      *      *      *      *      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a curious feeling!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must be shutting up like a  telescope.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face  brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going  through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she  waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about this; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor it might end, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  said Alice to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I  wonder what I should be like then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And she tried to fancy what the  flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could  not remember ever having seen such a thing.    After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going  into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the  door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she  went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach  it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her  best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;  and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing  sat down and cried.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no use in crying like that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice to herself,  rather sharply; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI advise you to leave off this minute!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She generally  gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),  and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into  her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having  cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,  for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no use now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought poor Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto pretend to be two  people! Why, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable  person!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEAT MEÃ¢\\x80\\x9d were beautifully marked in currants. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll eat it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said  Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it  makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll  get into the garden, and I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care which happens!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich way? Which  way?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was  growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same  size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice  had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way  things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go  on in the common way.    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.    *      *      *      *      *      *      *        *      *      *      *      *      *    *      *      *      *      *      *      *          CHAPTER II.  The Pool of Tears      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCuriouser and curiouser!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnow IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of  sight, they were getting so far off). Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, my poor little feet, I  wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m  sure _I_ shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble  myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;Ã¢\\x80\\x94but I must be  kind to them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor perhaps they wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t walk the way I  want to go! Let me see: IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll give them a new pair of boots every  Christmas.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey must  go by the carrier,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand how funny itÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll seem, sending  presents to oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!         _AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with       AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s love_).    Oh dear, what nonsense IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m talking!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was  now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden  key and hurried off to the garden door.    Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to  look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more  hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca great girl like  you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (she might well say this), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto go on crying in this way! Stop  this moment, I tell you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But she went on all the same, shedding  gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about  four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and  she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White  Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves  in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a  great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh! the Duchess, the  Duchess! Oh! wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t she be savage if IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve kept her waiting!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice felt  so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the  Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you please,  sirÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and  the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she  kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDear, dear! How  queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.  I wonder if IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the  same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling  a little different. But if IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not the same, the next question is, Who  in the world am I? Ah, _thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s_ the great puzzle!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And she began  thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as  herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not Ada,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor her hair goes in such long  ringlets, and mine doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go in ringlets at all; and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a  very little! Besides, _sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s_ she, and _IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m_ I, andÃ¢\\x80\\x94oh dear, how  puzzling it all is! IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll try if I know all the things I used to know.  Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,  and four times seven isÃ¢\\x80\\x94oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that  rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t signify: letÃ¢\\x80\\x99s try  Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of  Rome, and RomeÃ¢\\x80\\x94no, _thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s_ all wrong, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m certain! I must have been  changed for Mabel! IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll try and say Ã¢\\x80\\x98_How doth the little_Ã¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and she  crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began  to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words  did not come the same as they used to do:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow doth the little crocodile      Improve his shining tail,  And pour the waters of the Nile      On every golden scale!    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow cheerfully he seems to grin,      How neatly spread his claws,  And welcome little fishes in      With gently smiling jaws!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure those are not the right words,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said poor Alice, and her eyes  filled with tears again as she went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must be Mabel after all, and  I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to  no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve  made up my mind about it; if IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m Mabel, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll stay down here! ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be  no use their putting their heads down and saying Ã¢\\x80\\x98Come up again, dear!Ã¢\\x80\\x99  I shall only look up and say Ã¢\\x80\\x98Who am I then? Tell me that first, and  then, if I like being that person, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll come up: if not, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll stay down  here till IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m somebody elseÃ¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x94but, oh dear!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Alice, with a sudden  burst of tears, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so  _very_ tired of being all alone here!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see  that she had put on one of the RabbitÃ¢\\x80\\x99s little white kid gloves while  she was talking. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow _can_ I have done that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must be  growing small again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She got up and went to the table to measure  herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was  now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon  found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she  dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat _was_ a narrow escape!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, a good deal frightened at the  sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand  now for the garden!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and she ran with all speed back to the little  door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden  key was lying on the glass table as before, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand things are worse than  ever,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought the poor child, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor I never was so small as this  before, never! And I declare itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s too bad, that it is!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,  splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that  she had somehow fallen into the sea, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand in that case I can go back by  railway,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in  her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go  to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the  sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row  of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she  soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when  she was nine feet high.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wish I hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t cried so much!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, as she swam about, trying  to find her way out. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by  being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be  sure! However, everything is queer to-day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way  off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought  it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small  she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had  slipped in like herself.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWould it be of any use, now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto speak to this mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very  likely it can talk: at any rate, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no harm in trying.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So she  began: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired  of swimming about here, O Mouse!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (Alice thought this must be the right  way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but  she remembered having seen in her brotherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Latin Grammar, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA mouseÃ¢\\x80\\x94of  a mouseÃ¢\\x80\\x94to a mouseÃ¢\\x80\\x94a mouseÃ¢\\x80\\x94O mouse!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d) The Mouse looked at her rather  inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,  but it said nothing.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand English,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI daresay itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (For, with all  her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago  anything had happened.) So she began again: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOÃƒÂ¹ est ma chatte?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d which  was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a  sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with  fright. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, I beg your pardon!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she  had hurt the poor animalÃ¢\\x80\\x99s feelings. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI quite forgot you didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like  cats.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot like cats!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWould  _you_ like cats if you were me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, perhaps not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a soothing tone: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be angry  about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d  take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear  quiet thing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about  in the pool, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her  paws and washing her faceÃ¢\\x80\\x94and she is such a nice soft thing to  nurseÃ¢\\x80\\x94and sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s such a capital one for catching miceÃ¢\\x80\\x94oh, I beg your  pardon!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all  over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t talk  about her any more if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d rather not.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe indeed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his  tail. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always  _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t let me hear the name  again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t indeed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of  conversation. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAre youÃ¢\\x80\\x94are you fondÃ¢\\x80\\x94ofÃ¢\\x80\\x94of dogs?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The Mouse did not  answer, so Alice went on eagerly: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere is such a nice little dog near  our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you  know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And itÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll fetch things when  you throw them, and itÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts  of thingsÃ¢\\x80\\x94I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t remember half of themÃ¢\\x80\\x94and it belongs to a farmer, you  know, and he says itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s so useful, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s worth a hundred pounds! He says  it kills all the rats andÃ¢\\x80\\x94oh dear!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve offended it again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d For the Mouse was swimming away  from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the  pool as it went.    So she called softly after it, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMouse dear! Do come back again, and we  wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t talk about cats or dogs either, if you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like them!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d When the  Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face  was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low  trembling voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet us get to the shore, and then IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll tell you my  history, and youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the  birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a  Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice  led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.          CHAPTER III.  A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale      They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bankÃ¢\\x80\\x94the  birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close  to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.    The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a  consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite  natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if  she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument  with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am  older than you, and must know better;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and this Alice would not allow  without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to  tell its age, there was no more to be said.    At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,  called out, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll_ soon make  you dry enough!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the  Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she  felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAhem!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse with an important air, Ã¢\\x80\\x9care you all ready? This  is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! Ã¢\\x80\\x98William  the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted  to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much  accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of  Mercia and NorthumbriaÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cUgh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Lory, with a shiver.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDid  you speak?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot I!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Lory hastily.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI thought you did,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94I proceed. Ã¢\\x80\\x98Edwin and Morcar,  the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even  Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisableÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFound _what_?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duck.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFound _it_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mouse replied rather crossly: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cof course you know  what Ã¢\\x80\\x98itÃ¢\\x80\\x99 means.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know what Ã¢\\x80\\x98itÃ¢\\x80\\x99 means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the  Duck: Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the  archbishop find?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x98Ã¢\\x80\\x94found  it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him  the crown. WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence  of his NormansÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x99 How are you getting on now, my dear?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d it continued,  turning to Alice as it spoke.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAs wet as ever,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a melancholy tone: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t seem to  dry me at all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIn that case,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI move  that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic  remediesÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSpeak English!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Eaglet. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know the meaning of half  those long words, and, whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s more, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe you do either!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And  the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds  tittered audibly.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat I was going to say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dodo in an offended tone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwas,  that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat _is_ a Caucus-race?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice; not that she wanted much to  know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to  speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dodo, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe best way to explain it is to do it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (And,  as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will  tell you how the Dodo managed it.)    First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe exact  shape doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t matter,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d it said,) and then all the party were placed  along the course, here and there. There was no Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOne, two, three, and  away,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they  liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,  when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry  again, the Dodo suddenly called out Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe race is over!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and they all  crowded round it, panting, and asking, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut who has won?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of  thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its  forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the  pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo  said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut who is to give the prizes?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d quite a chorus of voices asked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, _she_, of course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one  finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a  confused way, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPrizes! Prizes!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her  pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had  not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly  one a-piece, all round.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Dodo replied very gravely. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat else have you got in  your pocket?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on, turning to Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOnly a thimble,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice sadly.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHand it over here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dodo.    Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly  presented the thimble, saying Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant  thimble;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and, when it had finished this short speech, they all  cheered.    Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave  that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything  to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as  she could.    The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and  confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste  theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.  However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and  begged the Mouse to tell them something more.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand why  it is you hateÃ¢\\x80\\x94C and D,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it  would be offended again.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMine is a long and a sad tale!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and  sighing.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt _is_ a long tail, certainly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, looking down with wonder  at the MouseÃ¢\\x80\\x99s tail; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut why do you call it sad?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And she kept on  puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the  tale was something like this:Ã¢\\x80\\x94             Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Let us both           go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.Ã¢\\x80\\x94Come, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll take no           denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve           nothing to do.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 Said the mouse to the cur, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Such a trial, dear           sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.Ã¢\\x80\\x99           Ã¢\\x80\\x98IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be judge, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be jury,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 Said cunning old Fury: Ã¢\\x80\\x98IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll           try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are not attending!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse to Alice severely. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are  you thinking of?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice very humbly: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou had got to the fifth  bend, I think?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI had _not!_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA knot!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking  anxiously about her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, do let me help to undo it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall do nothing of the sort,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mouse, getting up and  walking away. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou insult me by talking such nonsense!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pleaded poor Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re so easily offended,  you know!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Mouse only growled in reply.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPlease come back and finish your story!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice called after it; and  the others all joined in chorus, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, please do!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but the Mouse only  shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a pity it wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t stay!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d sighed the Lory, as soon as it was  quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to  her daughter Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose  _your_ temper!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHold your tongue, Ma!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the young Crab, a little  snappishly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re enough to try the patience of an oyster!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice aloud,  addressing nobody in particular. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99d soon fetch it back!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the  Lory.    Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDinahÃ¢\\x80\\x99s our cat. And sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s such a capital one for catching mice you  canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,  sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the  birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very  carefully, remarking, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI really must be getting home; the night-air  doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t suit my throat!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice  to its children, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome away, my dears! ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s high time you were all in  bed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left  alone.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wish I hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mentioned Dinah!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself in a melancholy  tone. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNobody seems to like her, down here, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the best  cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you  any more!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very  lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a  little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up  eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was  coming back to finish his story.          CHAPTER IV.  The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill      It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking  anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard  it muttering to itself Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh  my fur and whiskers! SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are  ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice guessed in a  moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid  gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but  they were nowhere to be seenÃ¢\\x80\\x94everything seemed to have changed since  her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the  little door, had vanished completely.    Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and  called out to her in an angry tone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you  doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and  a fan! Quick, now!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off  at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the  mistake it had made.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe took me for his housemaid,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself as she ran. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow  surprised heÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be when he finds out who I am! But IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d better take him  his fan and glovesÃ¢\\x80\\x94that is, if I can find them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d As she said this, she  came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass  plate with the name Ã¢\\x80\\x9cW. RABBIT,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d engraved upon it. She went in without  knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the  real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the  fan and gloves.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow queer it seems,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice said to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto be going messages for  a rabbit! I suppose DinahÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be sending me on messages next!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And she  began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x98Miss Alice! Come  here directly, and get ready for your walk!Ã¢\\x80\\x99 Ã¢\\x80\\x98Coming in a minute,  nurse! But IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got to see that the mouse doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get out.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 Only I  donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99d let Dinah stop in the house  if it began ordering people about like that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table  in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three  pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the  gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a  little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label  this time with the words Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDRINK ME,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but nevertheless she uncorked it  and put it to her lips. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know _something_ interesting is sure to  happen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so  IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll make me grow large  again, for really IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had  drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,  and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put  down the bottle, saying to herself Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s quite enoughÃ¢\\x80\\x94I hope I shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  grow any moreÃ¢\\x80\\x94As it is, I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get out at the doorÃ¢\\x80\\x94I do wish I hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  drunk quite so much!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,  and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there  was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with  one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out  of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow I  can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,  and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there  seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room  again, no wonder she felt unhappy.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt was much pleasanter at home,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought poor Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen one wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and  rabbits. I almost wish I hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t gone down that rabbit-holeÃ¢\\x80\\x94and yetÃ¢\\x80\\x94and  yetÃ¢\\x80\\x94itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what  _can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied  that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of  one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And  when I grow up, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll write oneÃ¢\\x80\\x94but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m grown up now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added in a  sorrowful tone; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cat least thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no room to grow up any more _here_.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshall I _never_ get any older than I am  now? ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be a comfort, one wayÃ¢\\x80\\x94never to be an old womanÃ¢\\x80\\x94but  thenÃ¢\\x80\\x94always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like _that!_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, you foolish Alice!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she answered herself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow can you learn  lessons in here? Why, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all  for any lesson-books!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and  making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes  she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMary Ann! Mary Ann!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the voice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFetch me my gloves this moment!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was  the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the  house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as  large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.    Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as  the door opened inwards, and AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s elbow was pressed hard against it,  that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll  go round and get in at the window.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_That_ you wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied  she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her  hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,  but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,  from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a  cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.    Next came an angry voiceÃ¢\\x80\\x94the RabbitÃ¢\\x80\\x99sÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPat! Pat! Where are you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And  then a voice she had never heard before, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSure then IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m here! Digging  for apples, yer honour!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDigging for apples, indeed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Rabbit angrily. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere! Come and  help me out of _this!_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (Sounds of more broken glass.)    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow tell me, Pat, whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s that in the window?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSure, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s an arm, yer honour!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (He pronounced it Ã¢\\x80\\x9carrum.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d)    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole  window!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSure, it does, yer honour: but itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s an arm for all that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers  now and then; such as, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSure, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like it, yer honour, at all, at  all!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo as I tell you, you coward!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and at last she spread out her  hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were  _two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a number  of cucumber-frames there must be!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder what  theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they  _could!_ IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure _I_ donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to stay in here any longer!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a  rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all  talking together: she made out the words: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the other  ladder?Ã¢\\x80\\x94Why, I hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t to bring but one; BillÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got the otherÃ¢\\x80\\x94Bill!  fetch it here, lad!Ã¢\\x80\\x94Here, put Ã¢\\x80\\x99em up at this cornerÃ¢\\x80\\x94No, tie Ã¢\\x80\\x99em  together firstÃ¢\\x80\\x94they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t reach half high enough yetÃ¢\\x80\\x94Oh! theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll do  well enough; donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be particularÃ¢\\x80\\x94Here, Bill! catch hold of this  ropeÃ¢\\x80\\x94Will the roof bear?Ã¢\\x80\\x94Mind that loose slateÃ¢\\x80\\x94Oh, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s coming down!  Heads below!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (a loud crash)Ã¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, who did that?Ã¢\\x80\\x94It was Bill, I  fancyÃ¢\\x80\\x94WhoÃ¢\\x80\\x99s to go down the chimney?Ã¢\\x80\\x94Nay, _I_ shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t! _You_ do  it!Ã¢\\x80\\x94_That_ I wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t, then!Ã¢\\x80\\x94BillÃ¢\\x80\\x99s to go downÃ¢\\x80\\x94Here, Bill! the master says  youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re to go down the chimney!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh! So BillÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got to come down the chimney, has he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice to  herself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be in  BillÃ¢\\x80\\x99s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but  I _think_ I can kick a little!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till  she heard a little animal (she couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t guess of what sort it was)  scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,  saying to herself Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis is Bill,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she gave one sharp kick, and waited  to see what would happen next.    The first thing she heard was a general chorus of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere goes Bill!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  then the RabbitÃ¢\\x80\\x99s voice alongÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCatch him, you by the hedge!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d then  silence, and then another confusion of voicesÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHold up his headÃ¢\\x80\\x94Brandy  nowÃ¢\\x80\\x94DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t choke himÃ¢\\x80\\x94How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell  us all about it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Bill,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought  Alice,) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I hardly knowÃ¢\\x80\\x94No more, thank ye; IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m better nowÃ¢\\x80\\x94but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m  a deal too flustered to tell youÃ¢\\x80\\x94all I know is, something comes at me  like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSo you did, old fellow!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the others.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe must burn the house down!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the RabbitÃ¢\\x80\\x99s voice; and Alice  called out as loud as she could, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you do, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll set Dinah at you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI  wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99d take the  roof off.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and  Alice heard the Rabbit say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA barrowful will do, to begin with.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA barrowful of _what?_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,  for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the  window, and some of them hit her in the face. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll put a stop to  this,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, and shouted out, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99d better not do that  again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d which produced another dead silence.    Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into  little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her  head. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf I eat one of these cakes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sure to make  _some_ change in my size; and as it canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t possibly make me larger, it  must make me smaller, I suppose.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she  began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get  through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of  little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,  was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it  something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she  appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself  safe in a thick wood.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe first thing IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got to do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice to herself, as she  wandered about in the wood, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis to grow to my right size again; and the  second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that  will be the best plan.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply  arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea  how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among  the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a  great hurry.    An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and  feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPoor little  thing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to  it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it  might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in  spite of all her coaxing.    Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and  held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off  all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,  and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,  to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the  other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head  over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was  very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every  moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then  the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very  little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely  all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with  its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.    This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she  set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,  and till the puppyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, as she leant  against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the  leaves: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifÃ¢\\x80\\x94if IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d  only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d nearly forgotten that  IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got to grow up again! Let me seeÃ¢\\x80\\x94how _is_ it to be managed? I  suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great  question is, what?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at  the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that  looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as  herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and  behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what  was on the top of it.    She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the  mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue  caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly  smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of  anything else.          CHAPTER V.  Advice from a Caterpillar      The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in  silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and  addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho are _you?_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,  rather shyly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x94I hardly know, sir, just at presentÃ¢\\x80\\x94at least I know  who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been  changed several times since then.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean by that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar sternly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cExplain  yourself!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t explain _myself_, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m  not myself, you see.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t put it more clearly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice replied very politely,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many  different sizes in a day is very confusing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, perhaps you havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t found it so yet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut when you  have to turn into a chrysalisÃ¢\\x80\\x94you will some day, you knowÃ¢\\x80\\x94and then  after that into a butterfly, I should think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll feel it a little  queer, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot a bit,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9call I know  is, it would feel very queer to _me_.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar contemptuously. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho are _you?_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the CaterpillarÃ¢\\x80\\x99s making such _very_  short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI  think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any  good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant  state of mind, she turned away.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome back!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Caterpillar called after her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve something  important to say!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKeep your temper,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs that all?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she  could.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,  and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For  some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded  its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSo you  think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re changed, do you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid I am, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t remember things as I  usedÃ¢\\x80\\x94and I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t keep the same size for ten minutes together!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t remember _what_ things?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve tried to say Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow doth the little busy bee,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but it all  came different!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRepeat, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_You are old, Father William_,Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Alice folded her hands, and began:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are old, Father William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the young man said,      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd your hair has become very white;  And yet you incessantly stand on your headÃ¢\\x80\\x94      Do you think, at your age, it is right?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIn my youth,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Father William replied to his son,      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI feared it might injure the brain;  But, now that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m perfectly sure I have none,      Why, I do it again and again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are old,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the youth, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas I mentioned before,      And have grown most uncommonly fat;  Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the doorÃ¢\\x80\\x94      Pray, what is the reason of that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIn my youth,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI kept all my limbs very supple  By the use of this ointmentÃ¢\\x80\\x94one shilling the boxÃ¢\\x80\\x94      Allow me to sell you a couple?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are old,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the youth, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand your jaws are too weak      For anything tougher than suet;  Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beakÃ¢\\x80\\x94      Pray, how did you manage to do it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIn my youth,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said his father, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI took to the law,      And argued each case with my wife;  And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,      Has lasted the rest of my life.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are old,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the youth, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cone would hardly suppose      That your eye was as steady as ever;  Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your noseÃ¢\\x80\\x94      What made you so awfully clever?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have answered three questions, and that is enough,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      Said his father; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t give yourself airs!  Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?      Be off, or IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll kick you down stairs!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat is not said right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot _quite_ right, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, timidly; Ã¢\\x80\\x9csome of the  words have got altered.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt is wrong from beginning to end,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar decidedly,  and there was silence for some minutes.    The Caterpillar was the first to speak.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat size do you want to be?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d it asked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not particular as to size,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice hastily replied; Ã¢\\x80\\x9conly one  doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like changing so often, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI _donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t_ know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life  before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAre you content now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  mind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthree inches is such a wretched height to be.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt is a very good height indeed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar angrily,  rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not used to it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she  thought of herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wish the creatures wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be so easily  offended!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll get used to it in time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar; and it put the  hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.    This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a  minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and  yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the  mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you  grow shorter.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice to  herself.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf the mushroom,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it  aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.    Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,  trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was  perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at  last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke  off a bit of the edge with each hand.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd now which is which?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of  the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a  violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!    She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt  that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she  set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed  so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her  mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the  lefthand bit.    *      *      *      *      *      *      *        *      *      *      *      *      *    *      *      *      *      *      *      *      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, my headÃ¢\\x80\\x99s free at last!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a tone of delight, which  changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders  were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was  an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a  sea of green leaves that lay far below her.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd where _have_ my  shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,  except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.    As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,  she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that  her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She  had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was  going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but  the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp  hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her  face, and was beating her violently with its wings.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSerpent!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d screamed the Pigeon.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m _not_ a serpent!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice indignantly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet me alone!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSerpent, I say again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued  tone, and added with a kind of sob, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve tried every way, and nothing  seems to suit them!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t the least idea what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re talking about,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve tried the roots of trees, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve tried banks, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve tried  hedges,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut those  serpents! ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no pleasing them!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in  saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAs if it wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t trouble enough hatching the eggs,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Pigeon;  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I  havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m very sorry youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been annoyed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, who was beginning to  see its meaning.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd just as IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d taken the highest tree in the wood,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d continued the  Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand just as I was thinking I  should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down  from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m aÃ¢\\x80\\x94IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m aÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell! _What_ are you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Pigeon. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI can see youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re trying to  invent something!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x94IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a little girl,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered  the number of changes she had gone through that day.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA likely story indeed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest  contempt. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never  _one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re a serpent; and thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  no use denying it. I suppose youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be telling me next that you never  tasted an egg!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, who was a very truthful  child; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you  know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Pigeon; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut if they do, why then  theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re a kind of serpent, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all I can say.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a  minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re  looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to  me whether youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re a little girl or a serpent?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt matters a good deal to _me_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice hastily; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not  looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want  _yours_: I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like them raw.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, be off, then!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled  down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well  as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,  and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while  she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,  and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at  the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until  she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.    It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it  felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,  and began talking to herself, as usual. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s half my plan  done now! How puzzling all these changes are! IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m never sure what IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m  going to be, from one minute to another! However, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got back to my  right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenÃ¢\\x80\\x94how  _is_ that to be done, I wonder?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d As she said this, she came suddenly  upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhoever lives there,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll never do to come upon them  _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So she  began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go  near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.          CHAPTER VI.  Pig and Pepper      For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what  to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the  woodÃ¢\\x80\\x94(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a  fish)Ã¢\\x80\\x94and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by  another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a  frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled  all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all  about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.    The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,  nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,  saying, in a solemn tone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFor the Duchess. An invitation from the  Queen to play croquet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn  tone, only changing the order of the words a little, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFrom the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.    Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood  for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the  Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the  door, staring stupidly up into the sky.    Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no sort of use in knocking,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Footman, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand that for  two reasons. First, because IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m on the same side of the door as you  are; secondly, because theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re making such a noise inside, no one could  possibly hear you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary  noise going on withinÃ¢\\x80\\x94a constant howling and sneezing, and every now  and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to  pieces.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPlease, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow am I to get in?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere might be some sense in your knocking,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Footman went on  without attending to her, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif we had the door between us. For instance,  if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you  know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and  this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps he canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  she said to herself; Ã¢\\x80\\x9chis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his  head. But at any rate he might answer questions.Ã¢\\x80\\x94How am I to get in?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  she repeated, aloud.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall sit here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Footman remarked, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctill tomorrowÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came  skimming out, straight at the FootmanÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head: it just grazed his nose,  and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94or next day, maybe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly  as if nothing had happened.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow am I to get in?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Alice again, in a louder tone.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_Are_ you to get in at all?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Footman. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the first  question, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s really  dreadful,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she muttered to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe way all the creatures argue.  ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s enough to drive one crazy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his  remark, with variations. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall sit here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9con and off, for  days and days.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut what am _I_ to do?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnything you like,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Footman, and began whistling.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no use in talking to him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice desperately: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  perfectly idiotic!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And she opened the door and went in.    The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from  one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool  in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,  stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s certainly too much pepper in that soup!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice said to  herself, as well as she could for sneezing.    There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed  occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling  alternately without a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s pause. The only things in the kitchen  that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting  on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPlease would you tell me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, a little timidly, for she was  not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhy  your cat grins like that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a Cheshire cat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s why. Pig!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite  jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the  baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  know that cats _could_ grin.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey all can,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand most of Ã¢\\x80\\x99em do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know of any that do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice said very politely, feeling quite  pleased to have got into a conversation.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a fact.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would  be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she  was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the  fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at  the Duchess and the babyÃ¢\\x80\\x94the fire-irons came first; then followed a  shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of  them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,  that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, _please_ mind what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re doing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Alice, jumping up and down  in an agony of terror. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d as an  unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it  off.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf everybody minded their own business,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Duchess said in a hoarse  growl, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich would _not_ be an advantage,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, who felt very glad to  get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJust  think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the  earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axisÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTalking of axes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cchop off her head!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take  the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to  be listening, so she went on again: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTwenty-four hours, I _think_; or  is it twelve? IÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t bother _me_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI never could abide  figures!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a  sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at  the end of every line:    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSpeak roughly to your little boy,      And beat him when he sneezes:  He only does it to annoy,      Because he knows it teases.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      CHORUS.  (In which the cook and the baby joined):      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWow! wow! wow!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing  the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,  that Alice could hardly hear the words:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI speak severely to my boy,      I beat him when he sneezes;  For he can thoroughly enjoy      The pepper when he pleases!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      CHORUS.      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWow! wow! wow!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Duchess said to Alice,  flinging the baby at her as she spoke. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must go and get ready to play  croquet with the Queen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and she hurried out of the room. The cook  threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.    Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped  little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cjust like a star-fish,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice. The poor little thing was  snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling  itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for  the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.    As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to  twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right  ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it  out into the open air. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t take this child away with me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  thought Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it be  murder to leave it behind?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She said the last words out loud, and the  little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t grunt,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not at all a proper way of  expressing yourself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face  to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had  a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also  its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did  not like the look of the thing at all. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps it was only  sobbing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there  were any tears.    No, there were no tears. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re going to turn into a pig, my dear,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  said Alice, seriously, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind  now!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible  to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.    Alice was just beginning to think to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, what am I to do  with this creature when I get it home?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d when it grunted again, so  violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time  there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than  a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it  further.    So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it  trot away quietly into the wood. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf it had grown up,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to  herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes  rather a handsome pig, I think.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And she began thinking over other  children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying  to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif one only knew the right way to change themÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d when she  was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of  a tree a few yards off.    The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she  thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she  felt that it ought to be treated with respect.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCheshire Puss,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know  whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little  wider. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s pleased so far,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice, and she went on.  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t much care whereÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen it doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t matter which way you go,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94so long as I get _somewhere_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice added as an explanation.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re sure to do that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you only walk long  enough.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another  question. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of people live about here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIn _that_ direction,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Cat said, waving its right paw round, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clives  a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d waving the other paw, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clives a  March Hare. Visit either you like: theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re both mad.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to go among mad people,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice remarked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, you canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cweÃ¢\\x80\\x99re all mad here. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m mad.  YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re mad.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow do you know IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m mad?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou must be,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor you wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have come here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think that proved it at all; however, she went on Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd how  do you know that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re mad?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTo begin with,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca dogÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not mad. You grant that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose so,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Cat went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou see, a dog growls when itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s angry,  and wags its tail when itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s pleased. Now _I_ growl when IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m pleased,  and wag my tail when IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m angry. Therefore IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m mad.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_I_ call it purring, not growling,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCall it what you like,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you play croquet with the  Queen to-day?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should like it very much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t been invited  yet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll see me there,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat, and vanished.    Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer  things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,  it suddenly appeared again.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99d nearly  forgotten to ask.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt turned into a pig,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back  in a natural way.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI thought it would,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat, and vanished again.    Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not  appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in  which the March Hare was said to live. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seen hatters before,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she  said to herself; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and  perhaps as this is May it wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be raving madÃ¢\\x80\\x94at least not so mad as it  was in March.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat  again, sitting on a branch of a tree.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDid you say pig, or fig?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI said pig,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I wish you wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t keep appearing  and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAll right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,  beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which  remained some time after the rest of it had gone.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell! IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve often seen a cat without a grin,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut a  grin without a cat! ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of  the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the  chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It  was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had  nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself  to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather  timidly, saying to herself Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSuppose it should be raving mad after all!  I almost wish IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d gone to see the Hatter instead!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d          CHAPTER VII.  A Mad Tea-Party      There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the  March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting  between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a  cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery  uncomfortable for the Dormouse,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9conly, as itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s asleep,  I suppose it doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mind.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at  one corner of it: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo room! No room!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d they cried out when they saw  Alice coming. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s _plenty_ of room!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice indignantly, and  she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHave some wine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.    Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see any wine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she remarked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t any,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen it wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t very civil of you to offer it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice angrily.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said  the March Hare.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know it was _your_ table,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s laid for a great  many more than three.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYour hair wants cutting,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter. He had been looking at  Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first  speech.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou should learn not to make personal remarks,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice said with some  severity; Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very rude.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_  was, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy is a raven like a writing-desk?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, we shall have some fun now!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m glad theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve  begun asking riddles.Ã¢\\x80\\x94I believe I can guess that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added aloud.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said  the March Hare.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cExactly so,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen you should say what you mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the March Hare went on.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice hastily replied; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cat leastÃ¢\\x80\\x94at least I mean what I  sayÃ¢\\x80\\x94thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the same thing, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot the same thing a bit!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou might just as well  say that Ã¢\\x80\\x98I see what I eatÃ¢\\x80\\x99 is the same thing as Ã¢\\x80\\x98I eat what I seeÃ¢\\x80\\x99!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou might just as well say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added the March Hare, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat Ã¢\\x80\\x98I like what  I getÃ¢\\x80\\x99 is the same thing as Ã¢\\x80\\x98I get what I likeÃ¢\\x80\\x99!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou might just as well say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added the Dormouse, who seemed to be  talking in his sleep, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat Ã¢\\x80\\x98I breathe when I sleepÃ¢\\x80\\x99 is the same thing  as Ã¢\\x80\\x98I sleep when I breatheÃ¢\\x80\\x99!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt _is_ the same thing with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter, and here the  conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while  Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and  writing-desks, which wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t much.    The Hatter was the first to break the silence. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat day of the month  is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his  pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,  and holding it to his ear.    Alice considered a little, and then said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe fourth.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTwo days wrong!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d sighed the Hatter. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI told you butter wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t suit  the works!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added looking angrily at the March Hare.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt was the _best_ butter,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the March Hare meekly replied.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter grumbled:  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have put it in with the bread-knife.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped  it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of  nothing better to say than his first remark, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt was the _best_ butter,  you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a  funny watch!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she remarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt tells the day of the month, and doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  tell what oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock it is!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy should it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d muttered the Hatter. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDoes _your_ watch tell you what  year it is?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice replied very readily: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s because it  stays the same year for such a long time together.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich is just the case with _mine_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter.    Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The HatterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s remark seemed to have no  sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t quite  understand you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, as politely as she could.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe Dormouse is asleep again,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter, and he poured a little  hot tea upon its nose.    The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its  eyes, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHave you guessed the riddle yet?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter said, turning to Alice  again.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, I give it up,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice replied: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the answer?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t the slightest idea,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNor I,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare.    Alice sighed wearily. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think you might do something better with the  time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthan waste it in asking riddles that have no  answers.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you knew Time as well as I do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t talk  about wasting _it_. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s _him_.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what you mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter said, tossing his head  contemptuously. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI dare say you never even spoke to Time!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice cautiously replied: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I know I have to beat  time when I learn music.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh! that accounts for it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t stand beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, heÃ¢\\x80\\x99d do almost anything  you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock in  the morning, just time to begin lessons: youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d only have to whisper a  hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,  time for dinner!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    (Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI only wish it was,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat would be grand, certainly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice thoughtfully: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut thenÃ¢\\x80\\x94I  shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be hungry for it, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot at first, perhaps,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut you could keep it to  half-past one as long as you liked.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs that the way _you_ manage?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice asked.    The Hatter shook his head mournfully. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot I!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe  quarrelled last MarchÃ¢\\x80\\x94just before _he_ went mad, you knowÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (pointing  with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94it was at the great concert  given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing    Ã¢\\x80\\x98Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!  How I wonder what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re at!Ã¢\\x80\\x99      You know the song, perhaps?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve heard something like it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt goes on, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter continued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin this way:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x98Up above the world you fly,  Like a tea-tray in the sky.                      Twinkle, twinkleÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep  Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_Ã¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and went on so long that they  had to pinch it to make it stop.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d hardly finished the first verse,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen the  Queen jumped up and bawled out, Ã¢\\x80\\x98HeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s murdering the time! Off with his  head!Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow dreadfully savage!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd ever since that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  do a thing I ask! ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s always six oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    A bright idea came into AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs that the reason so many  tea-things are put out here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter with a sigh: Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s always tea-time,  and weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve no time to wash the things between whiles.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen you keep moving round, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cExactly so,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas the things get used up.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut what happens when you come to the beginning again?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice ventured  to ask.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSuppose we change the subject,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the March Hare interrupted, yawning.  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know one,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, rather alarmed at the  proposal.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen the Dormouse shall!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d they both cried. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWake up, Dormouse!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And  they pinched it on both sides at once.    The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t asleep,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said in a  hoarse, feeble voice: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI heard every word you fellows were saying.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTell us a story!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, please do!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pleaded Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd be quick about it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added the Hatter, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be asleep again  before itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s done.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOnce upon a time there were three little sisters,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Dormouse began  in a great hurry; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and  they lived at the bottom of a wellÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat did they live on?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, who always took a great interest  in questions of eating and drinking.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey lived on treacle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or  two.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have done that, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice gently remarked;  Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99d have been ill.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSo they were,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse; Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_very_ ill.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of  living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut  why did they live at the bottom of a well?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTake some more tea,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve had nothing yet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice replied in an offended tone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cso I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  take more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou mean you canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t take _less_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter: Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very easy to  take _more_ than nothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNobody asked _your_ opinion,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhoÃ¢\\x80\\x99s making personal remarks now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter asked triumphantly.    Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to  some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and  repeated her question. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy did they live at the bottom of a well?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then  said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt was a treacle-well.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no such thing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice was beginning very angrily, but the  Hatter and the March Hare went Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSh! sh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and the Dormouse sulkily  remarked, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be civil, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d better finish the story for  yourself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, please go on!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice said very humbly; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t interrupt again. I  dare say there may be _one_.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOne, indeed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to  go on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd so these three little sistersÃ¢\\x80\\x94they were learning to draw,  you knowÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat did they draw?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTreacle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI want a clean cup,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d interrupted the Hatter: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cletÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all move one place  on.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare  moved into the DormouseÃ¢\\x80\\x99s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the  place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any  advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than  before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.    Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very  cautiously: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand. Where did they draw the treacle  from?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou can draw water out of a water-well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cso I should  think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-wellÃ¢\\x80\\x94eh, stupid?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut they were _in_ the well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing  to notice this last remark.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course they were,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94well in.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for  some time without interrupting it.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey were learning to draw,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing  its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand they drew all manner of  thingsÃ¢\\x80\\x94everything that begins with an MÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy with an M?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy not?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare.    Alice was silent.    The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a  doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a  little shriek, and went on: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94that begins with an M, such as  mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchnessÃ¢\\x80\\x94you know you say  things are Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmuch of a muchnessÃ¢\\x80\\x9dÃ¢\\x80\\x94did you ever see such a thing as a  drawing of a muchness?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cReally, now you ask me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, very much confused, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  thinkÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen you shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t talk,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter.    This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in  great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and  neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she  looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into  the teapot.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAt any rate IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll never go _there_ again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice as she picked her  way through the wood. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in  all my life!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door  leading right into it. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very curious!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut  everythingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And  in she went.    Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little  glass table. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll manage better this time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself,  and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that  led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom  (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot  high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_Ã¢\\x80\\x94she found  herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds  and the cool fountains.          CHAPTER VIII.  The QueenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Croquet-Ground      A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses  growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily  painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she  went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard  one of them say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLook out now, Five! DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go splashing paint over me  like that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Five, in a sulky tone; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSeven jogged my  elbow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    On which Seven looked up and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s right, Five! Always lay the  blame on others!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99d_ better not talk!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Five. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI heard the Queen say only  yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the one who had spoken first.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s none of _your_ business, Two!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Seven.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, it _is_ his business!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Five, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll tell himÃ¢\\x80\\x94it was for  bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, of all the unjust  thingsÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching  them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,  and all of them bowed low.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWould you tell me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, a little timidly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhy you are  painting those roses?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low  voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a  _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen  was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So  you see, Miss, weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re doing our best, afore she comes, toÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d At this  moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called  out Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe Queen! The Queen!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and the three gardeners instantly threw  themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,  and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.    First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the  three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the  corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with  diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came  the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came  jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all  ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,  and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a  hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went  by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying  the KingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this  grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.    Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face  like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard  of such a rule at processions; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand besides, what would be the use of a  procession,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought she, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif people had all to lie down upon their  faces, so that they couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So she stood still where she was,  and waited.    When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked  at her, and the Queen said severely Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho is this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She said it to the  Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIdiot!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to  Alice, she went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s your name, child?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice very politely;  but she added, to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re only a pack of cards, after  all. I neednÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be afraid of them!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd who are _these?_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners  who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on  their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of  the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,  or courtiers, or three of her own children.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow should _I_ know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, surprised at her own courage. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  no business of _mine_.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a  moment like a wild beast, screamed Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOff with her head! OffÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNonsense!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was  silent.    The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cConsider, my  dear: she is only a child!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTurn  them over!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGet up!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three  gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,  the royal children, and everybody else.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLeave off that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d screamed the Queen. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou make me giddy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And then,  turning to the rose-tree, she went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat _have_ you been doing  here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMay it please your Majesty,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Two, in a very humble tone, going  down on one knee as he spoke, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe were tryingÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_I_ see!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOff with their heads!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and the procession moved on, three of the  soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran  to Alice for protection.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be beheaded!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, and she put them into a large  flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a  minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the  others.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAre their heads off?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d shouted the Queen.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the soldiers shouted  in reply.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s right!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d shouted the Queen. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCan you play croquet?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was  evidently meant for her.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d shouted Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome on, then!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,  wondering very much what would happen next.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99sÃ¢\\x80\\x94itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a very fine day!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said a timid voice at her side. She was  walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94whereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the Duchess?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHush! Hush!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked  anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon  tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s under  sentence of execution.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDid you say Ã¢\\x80\\x98What a pity!Ã¢\\x80\\x99?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Rabbit asked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s at all a pity. I said  Ã¢\\x80\\x98What for?Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe boxed the QueenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s earsÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little  scream of laughter. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, hush!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Rabbit whispered in a frightened  tone. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the  Queen saidÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGet to your places!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and  people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each  other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game  began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground  in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live  hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double  themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.    The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,  under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she  had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the  hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look  up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help  bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was  going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog  had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all  this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she  wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were  always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice  soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.    The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling  all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time  the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and  shouting Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOff with his head!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d or Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOff with her head!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d about once in a  minute.    Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any  dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought she, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat would become of me? TheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re dreadfully  fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s any  one left alive!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she  could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious  appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after  watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said  to herself Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk  to.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow are you getting on?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth  enough for it to speak with.    Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no use  speaking to it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctill its ears have come, or at least one  of them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put  down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad  she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there  was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think they play at all fairly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice began, in rather a  complaining tone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand they all quarrel so dreadfully one canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t hear  oneself speakÃ¢\\x80\\x94and they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t seem to have any rules in particular; at  least, if there are, nobody attends to themÃ¢\\x80\\x94and youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve no idea how  confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the  arch IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the  groundÃ¢\\x80\\x94and I should have croqueted the QueenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hedgehog just now, only  it ran away when it saw mine coming!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow do you like the Queen?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Cat in a low voice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot at all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice: Ã¢\\x80\\x9csheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s so extremelyÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Just then she noticed  that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94likely to win, that itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hardly worth while finishing the game.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Queen smiled and passed on.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho _are_ you talking to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King, going up to Alice, and  looking at the CatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head with great curiosity.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a friend of mineÃ¢\\x80\\x94a Cheshire Cat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice: Ã¢\\x80\\x9callow me to  introduce it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like the look of it at all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King: Ã¢\\x80\\x9chowever, it may  kiss my hand if it likes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99d rather not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Cat remarked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be impertinent,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t look at me like  that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He got behind Alice as he spoke.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA cat may look at a king,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve read that in some book,  but I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t remember where.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, it must be removed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King very decidedly, and he called  the Queen, who was passing at the moment, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear! I wish you would  have this cat removed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or  small. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOff with his head!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, without even looking round.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll fetch the executioner myself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King eagerly, and he  hurried off.    Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going  on, as she heard the QueenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s voice in the distance, screaming with  passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be  executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look  of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew  whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.    The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed  to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the  other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to  the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a  helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.    By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight  was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut it doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  matter much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas all the arches are gone from this side  of the ground.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not  escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her  friend.    When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite  a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between  the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,  while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.    The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle  the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they  all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly  what they said.    The executionerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s argument was, that you couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t cut off a head unless  there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a  thing before, and he wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t going to begin at _his_ time of life.    The KingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s argument was, that anything that had a head could be  beheaded, and that you werenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t to talk nonsense.    The QueenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s argument was, that if something wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t done about it in  less than no time sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99d have everybody executed, all round. (It was  this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and  anxious.)    Alice could think of nothing else to say but Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt belongs to the  Duchess: youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d better ask _her_ about it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s in prison,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Queen said to the executioner: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfetch her here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  And the executioner went off like an arrow.    The CatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the  time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so  the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,  while the rest of the party went back to the game.          CHAPTER IX.  The Mock TurtleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Story      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s,  and they walked off together.    Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought  to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so  savage when they met in the kitchen.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhen _IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m_ a Duchess,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful  tone though), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup  does very well withoutÃ¢\\x80\\x94Maybe itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s always pepper that makes people  hot-tempered,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new  kind of rule, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand vinegar that makes them sourÃ¢\\x80\\x94and camomile that makes  them bitterÃ¢\\x80\\x94andÃ¢\\x80\\x94and barley-sugar and such things that make children  sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be  so stingy about it, you knowÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little  startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re thinking  about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in  a bit.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t one,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice ventured to remark.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTut, tut, child!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEverythingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got a moral, if only  you can find it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And she squeezed herself up closer to AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s side as  she spoke.    Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the  Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the  right height to rest her chin upon AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s shoulder, and it was an  uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she  bore it as well as she could.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe gameÃ¢\\x80\\x99s going on rather better now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, by way of keeping up  the conversation a little.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x99Tis so,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand the moral of that isÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x98Oh, Ã¢\\x80\\x99tis love,  Ã¢\\x80\\x99tis love, that makes the world go round!Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSomebody said,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice whispered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s done by everybody minding  their own business!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh, well! It means much the same thing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess, digging her  sharp little chin into AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s shoulder as she added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand the moral of  _that_ isÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x98Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of  themselves.Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow fond she is of finding morals in things!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice thought to  herself.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI dare say youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re wondering why I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t put my arm round your waist,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  the Duchess said after a pause: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe reason is, that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m doubtful about  the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe might bite,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious  to have the experiment tried.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery true,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cflamingoes and mustard both bite. And  the moral of that isÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x98Birds of a feather flock together.Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOnly mustard isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a bird,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice remarked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRight, as usual,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat a clear way you have of  putting things!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a mineral, I _think_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course it is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to  everything that Alice said; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a large mustard-mine near here.  And the moral of that isÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x98The more there is of mine, the less there is  of yours.Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, I know!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last  remark, Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a vegetable. It doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t look like one, but it is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI quite agree with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand the moral of that  isÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x98Be what you would seem to beÃ¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x94or if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d like it put more  simplyÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x98Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might  appear to others that what you were or might have been was not  otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be  otherwise.Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think I should understand that better,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice said very politely,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif I had it written down: but I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t quite follow it as you say it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nothing to what I could say if I chose,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Duchess replied,  in a pleased tone.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPray donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said  Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t talk about trouble!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI make you a present  of everything IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve said as yet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA cheap sort of present!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m glad they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t give  birthday presents like that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But she did not venture to say it out  loud.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThinking again?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp  little chin.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve a right to think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to  feel a little worried.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJust about as much right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Duchess, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas pigs have to fly; and  the mÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    But here, to AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s great surprise, the DuchessÃ¢\\x80\\x99s voice died away,  even in the middle of her favourite word Ã¢\\x80\\x98moral,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 and the arm that was  linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the  Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a  thunderstorm.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA fine day, your Majesty!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, I give you fair warning,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d shouted the Queen, stamping on the  ground as she spoke; Ã¢\\x80\\x9ceither you or your head must be off, and that in  about half no time! Take your choice!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s go on with the game,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too  much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the  croquet-ground.    The other guests had taken advantage of the QueenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s absence, and were  resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried  back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s delay  would cost them their lives.    All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling  with the other players, and shouting Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOff with his head!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d or Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOff with  her head!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the  soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so  that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and  all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody  and under sentence of execution.    Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHave  you seen the Mock Turtle yet?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t even know what a Mock Turtle is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI never saw one, or heard of one,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome on, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand he shall tell you his history,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,  to the company generally, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are all pardoned.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, _thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s_ a  good thing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the  number of executions the Queen had ordered.    They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If  you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cUp, lazy  thing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand take this young lady to see the Mock  Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some  executions I have ordered;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and she walked off, leaving Alice alone  with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,  but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it  as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.    The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till  she was out of sight: then it chuckled. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat fun!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon,  half to itself, half to Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat _is_ the fun?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, _she_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all her fancy, that: they never  executes nobody, you know. Come on!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEverybody says Ã¢\\x80\\x98come on!Ã¢\\x80\\x99 here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice, as she went slowly  after it: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI never was so ordered about in all my life, never!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,  sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came  nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She  pitied him deeply. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is his sorrow?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked the Gryphon, and the  Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all  his fancy, that: he hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes  full of tears, but said nothing.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis here young lady,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshe wants for to know your  history, she do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll tell it her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: Ã¢\\x80\\x9csit  down, both of you, and donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t speak a word till IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve finished.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to  herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t begin.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  But she waited patiently.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOnce,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI was a real  Turtle.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an  occasional exclamation of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHjckrrh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d from the Gryphon, and the constant  heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and  saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThank you, sir, for your interesting story,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but she could not  help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said  nothing.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhen we were little,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,  though still sobbing a little now and then, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe went to school in the  sea. The master was an old TurtleÃ¢\\x80\\x94we used to call him TortoiseÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t one?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice asked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle  angrily: Ã¢\\x80\\x9creally you are very dull!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple  question,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked  at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the  Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDrive on, old fellow! DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be all  day about it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and he went on in these words:    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, we went to school in the sea, though you maynÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe itÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI never said I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d interrupted Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou did,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHold your tongue!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.  The Mock Turtle went on.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe had the best of educationsÃ¢\\x80\\x94in fact, we went to school every dayÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve_ been to a day-school, too,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou neednÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be so  proud as all that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWith extras?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe learned French and music.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd washing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCertainly not!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice indignantly.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh! then yours wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a really good school,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle in a  tone of great relief. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,  Ã¢\\x80\\x98French, music, _and washing_Ã¢\\x80\\x94extra.Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have wanted it much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cliving at the bottom  of the sea.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t afford to learn it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI  only took the regular course.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat was that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d inquired Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle  replied; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand then the different branches of ArithmeticÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ambition,  Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI never heard of Ã¢\\x80\\x98Uglification,Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice ventured to say. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat! Never heard of  uglifying!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d it exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou know what to beautify is, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice doubtfully: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit meansÃ¢\\x80\\x94toÃ¢\\x80\\x94makeÃ¢\\x80\\x94anythingÃ¢\\x80\\x94prettier.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what to uglify  is, you _are_ a simpleton.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so  she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat else had you to learn?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, there was Mystery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the  subjects on his flappers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94Mystery, ancient and modern, with  Seaography: then DrawlingÃ¢\\x80\\x94the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,  that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and  Fainting in Coils.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat was _that_ like?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t show it you myself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle said: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m too  stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI went to the Classics master,  though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI never went to him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: Ã¢\\x80\\x9che taught  Laughing and Grief, they used to say.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSo he did, so he did,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both  creatures hid their faces in their paws.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, in a hurry  to change the subject.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTen hours the first day,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnine the next, and so  on.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a curious plan!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the reason theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re called lessons,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon remarked:  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause they lessen from day to day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little  before she made her next remark. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen the eleventh day must have been  a holiday?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course it was,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice went on eagerly.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s enough about lessons,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon interrupted in a very  decided tone: Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctell her something about the games now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d          CHAPTER X.  The Lobster Quadrille      The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across  his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or  two sobs choked his voice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSame as if he had a bone in his throat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in  the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears  running down his cheeks, he went on again:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou may not have lived much under the seaÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said  Alice)Ã¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobsterÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  (Alice began to say Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI once tastedÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but checked herself hastily, and  said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, neverÃ¢\\x80\\x9d) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a  Lobster Quadrille is!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of a dance is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou first form into a line along the  sea-shoreÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTwo lines!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried the Mock Turtle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on;  then, when youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the wayÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_That_ generally takes some time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d interrupted the Gryphon.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94you advance twiceÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEach with a lobster as a partner!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried the Gryphon.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle said: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cadvance twice, set to partnersÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94change lobsters, and retire in same order,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d continued the Gryphon.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou throw theÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe lobsters!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94as far out to sea as you canÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSwim after them!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d screamed the Gryphon.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTurn a somersault in the sea!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly  about.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cChange lobsters again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBack to land again, and thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all the first figure,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock  Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had  been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very  sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt must be a very pretty dance,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice timidly.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWould you like to see a little of it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery much indeed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, letÃ¢\\x80\\x99s try the first figure!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle to the  Gryphon. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, _you_ sing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve forgotten the words.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and  then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their  forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly  and sadly:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWill you walk a little faster?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said a whiting to a snail.  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a porpoise close behind us, and heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s treading on my tail.  See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!  They are waiting on the shingleÃ¢\\x80\\x94will you come and join the dance?  Will you, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, will you, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, will you join the dance?  Will you, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, will you, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you join the dance?    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  But the snail replied Ã¢\\x80\\x9cToo far, too far!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and gave a look askanceÃ¢\\x80\\x94  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.  Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.  Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat matters it how far we go?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d his scaly friend replied.  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.  The further off from England the nearer is to FranceÃ¢\\x80\\x94  Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.  Will you, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, will you, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, will you join the dance?  Will you, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, will you, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you join the dance?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThank you, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a very interesting dance to watch,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice,  feeling very glad that it was over at last: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I do so like that  curious song about the whiting!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, as to the whiting,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctheyÃ¢\\x80\\x94youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seen them,  of course?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve often seen them at dinnÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she checked herself  hastily.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know where Dinn may be,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve  seen them so often, of course you know what theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re like.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI believe so,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice replied thoughtfully. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey have their tails in  their mouthsÃ¢\\x80\\x94and theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re all over crumbs.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re wrong about the crumbs,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle: Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccrumbs would  all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;  and the reason isÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his  eyes.Ã¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTell her about the reason and all that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said to the Gryphon.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe reason is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat they _would_ go with the  lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to  fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they  couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get them out again. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThank you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very interesting. I never knew so much  about a whiting before.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI can tell you more than that, if you like,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you  know why itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s called a whiting?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI never thought about it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_It does the boots and shoes_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon replied very solemnly.    Alice was thoroughly puzzled. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDoes the boots and shoes!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated  in a wondering tone.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, what are _your_ shoes done with?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI mean, what  makes them so shiny?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her  answer. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re done with blacking, I believe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBoots and shoes under the sea,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9care done with a whiting. Now you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what are they made of?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSoles and eels, of course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cany shrimp could have told you that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d been the whiting,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, whose thoughts were still  running on the song, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99d have said to the porpoise, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Keep back,  please: we donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want _you_ with us!Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey were obliged to have him with them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle said: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cno  wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it really?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice in a tone of great surprise.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhy, if a fish came to _me_,  and told me he was going a journey, I should say Ã¢\\x80\\x98With what porpoise?Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you mean Ã¢\\x80\\x98purposeÃ¢\\x80\\x99?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI mean what I say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And  the Gryphon added Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, letÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hear some of _your_ adventures.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI could tell you my adventuresÃ¢\\x80\\x94beginning from this morning,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said  Alice a little timidly: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no use going back to yesterday,  because I was a different person then.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cExplain all that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no! The adventures first,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cexplanations take such a dreadful time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first  saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,  the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened  their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she  went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part  about her repeating Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_You are old, Father William_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d to the  Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock  Turtle drew a long breath, and said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very curious.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all about as curious as it can be,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt all came different!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI  should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to  begin.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of  authority over Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cStand up and repeat Ã¢\\x80\\x98Ã¢\\x80\\x99_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the  Gryphon.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  thought Alice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI might as well be at school at once.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d However, she got  up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster  Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came  very queer indeed:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x99Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    [later editions continued as follows  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said  the Gryphon.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I never heard it before,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut it sounds  uncommon nonsense.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,  wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should like to have it explained,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Mock Turtle.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t explain it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon hastily. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGo on with the next  verse.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut about his toes?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle persisted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow _could_ he turn  them out with his nose, you know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the first position in dancing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice said; but was dreadfully  puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGo on with the next verse,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon repeated impatiently: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit  begins Ã¢\\x80\\x98_I passed by his garden_.Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come  wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pieÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    [later editions continued as follows  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,  And concluded the banquetÃ¢\\x80\\x94]      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Mock Turtle  interrupted, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t explain it as you go on? ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s by far the  most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d better leave off,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Gryphon: and Alice was  only too glad to do so.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon  went on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice  replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her Ã¢\\x80\\x98_Turtle Soup_,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 will you, old  fellow?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked  with sobs, to sing this:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBeautiful Soup, so rich and green,  Waiting in a hot tureen!  Who for such dainties would not stoop?  Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!  Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!      BeauÃ¢\\x80\\x94ootiful SooÃ¢\\x80\\x94oop!      BeauÃ¢\\x80\\x94ootiful SooÃ¢\\x80\\x94oop!  SooÃ¢\\x80\\x94oop of the eÃ¢\\x80\\x94eÃ¢\\x80\\x94evening,      Beautiful, beautiful Soup!    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBeautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,  Game, or any other dish?  Who would not give all else for two p  ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?  Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?      BeauÃ¢\\x80\\x94ootiful SooÃ¢\\x80\\x94oop!      BeauÃ¢\\x80\\x94ootiful SooÃ¢\\x80\\x94oop!  SooÃ¢\\x80\\x94oop of the eÃ¢\\x80\\x94eÃ¢\\x80\\x94evening,      Beautiful, beautiÃ¢\\x80\\x94FUL SOUP!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cChorus again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun  to repeat it, when a cry of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe trialÃ¢\\x80\\x99s beginning!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d was heard in the  distance.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome on!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried  off, without waiting for the end of the song.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat trial is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only  answered Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome on!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and ran the faster, while more and more faintly  came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSooÃ¢\\x80\\x94oop of the eÃ¢\\x80\\x94eÃ¢\\x80\\x94evening,      Beautiful, beautiful Soup!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d          CHAPTER XI.  Who Stole the Tarts?      The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they  arrived, with a great crowd assembled about themÃ¢\\x80\\x94all sorts of little  birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was  standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard  him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one  hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the  court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so  good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wish theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99d  get the trial done,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand hand round the refreshments!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at  everything about her, to pass away the time.    Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read  about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew  the name of nearly everything there. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the judge,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to  herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause of his great wig.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the  wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he  did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the jury-box,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand those twelve creatures,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  (she was obliged to say Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccreatures,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d you see, because some of them were  animals, and some were birds,) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose they are the jurors.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She  said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather  proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little  girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cjury-menÃ¢\\x80\\x9d  would have done just as well.    The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are  they doing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice whispered to the Gryphon. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have anything  to put down yet, before the trialÃ¢\\x80\\x99s begun.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re putting down their names,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Gryphon whispered in reply,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cStupid things!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she  stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSilence in the  court!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,  to make out who was talking.    Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,  that all the jurors were writing down Ã¢\\x80\\x9cstupid things!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d on their slates,  and she could even make out that one of them didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know how to spell  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cstupid,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA nice  muddle their slatesÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be in before the trialÃ¢\\x80\\x99s over!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice.    One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice  could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and  very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly  that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out  at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he  was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this  was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHerald, read the accusation!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King.    On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then  unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,      All on a summer day:  The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,      And took them quite away!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cConsider your verdict,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King said to the jury.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot yet, not yet!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Rabbit hastily interrupted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a great  deal to come before that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCall the first witness,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King; and the White Rabbit blew  three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFirst witness!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand  and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI beg pardon, your  Majesty,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he began, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor bringing these in: but I hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t quite finished  my tea when I was sent for.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou ought to have finished,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhen did you begin?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the  court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFourteenth of March, I _think_ it  was,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFifteenth,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSixteenth,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added the Dormouse.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWrite that down,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly  wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and  reduced the answer to shillings and pence.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTake off your hat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King said to the Hatter.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_Stolen!_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made  a memorandum of the fact.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI keep them to sell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter added as an explanation; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve none  of my own. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a hatter.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,  who turned pale and fidgeted.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGive your evidence,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be nervous, or IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll  have you executed on the spot.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting  from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his  confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the  bread-and-butter.    Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled  her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to  grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave  the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was  as long as there was room for her.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wish you wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t squeeze so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse, who was sitting  next to her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI can hardly breathe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice very meekly: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m growing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve no right to grow _here_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t talk nonsense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice more boldly: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou know youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re growing  too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Dormouse: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot in  that ridiculous fashion.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And he got up very sulkily and crossed over  to the other side of the court.    All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,  just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers  of the court, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBring me the list of the singers in the last concert!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes  off.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGive your evidence,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King repeated angrily, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll have you  executed, whether youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re nervous or not.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a poor man, your Majesty,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94and I hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t begun my teaÃ¢\\x80\\x94not above a week or soÃ¢\\x80\\x94and what with the  bread-and-butter getting so thinÃ¢\\x80\\x94and the twinkling of the teaÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe twinkling of the _what?_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt _began_ with the tea,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter replied.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course twinkling begins with a T!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King sharply. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you  take me for a dunce? Go on!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a poor man,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand most things twinkled after  thatÃ¢\\x80\\x94only the March Hare saidÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou did!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI deny it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the March Hare.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe denies it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cleave out that part.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, at any rate, the Dormouse saidÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Hatter went on, looking  anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied  nothing, being fast asleep.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAfter that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d continued the Hatter, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI cut some more bread-and-butterÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut what did the Dormouse say?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d one of the jury asked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t remember,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou _must_ remember,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d remarked the King, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll have you executed.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went  down on one knee. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a poor man, your Majesty,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he began.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re a _very_ poor _speaker_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King.    Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by  the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just  explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied  up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,  head first, and then sat upon it.)    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m glad IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seen that done,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve so often read in  the newspapers, at the end of trials, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere was some attempts at  applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the  court,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and I never understood what it meant till now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all you know about it, you may stand down,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d continued the  King.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go no lower,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m on the floor, as it is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen you may _sit_ down,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King replied.    Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, that finished the guinea-pigs!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow we shall get  on better.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99d rather finish my tea,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Hatter, with an anxious look at  the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou may go,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,  without even waiting to put his shoes on.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94and just take his head off outside,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Queen added to one of the  officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get  to the door.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCall the next witness!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King.    The next witness was the DuchessÃ¢\\x80\\x99s cook. She carried the pepper-box in  her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the  court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGive your evidence,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the cook.    The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYour Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, if I must, I must,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King said, with a melancholy air, and,  after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were  nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are tarts made of?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPepper, mostly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the cook.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTreacle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said a sleepy voice behind her.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCollar that Dormouse,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Queen shrieked out. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBehead that Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his  whiskers!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse  turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had  disappeared.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNever mind!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King, with an air of great relief. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCall the  next witness.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And he added in an undertone to the Queen, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cReally, my  dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my  forehead ache!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling  very curious to see what the next witness would be like, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94for they  havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t got much evidence _yet_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself. Imagine her  surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill  little voice, the name Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAlice!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d          CHAPTER XII.  AliceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Evidence      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how  large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such  a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,  upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there  they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of  goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, I _beg_ your pardon!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and  began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident  of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of  idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the  jury-box, or they would die.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe trial cannot proceed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King in a very grave voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cuntil  all the jurymen are back in their proper placesÃ¢\\x80\\x94_all_,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated  with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.    Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put  the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its  tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon  got it out again, and put it right; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot that it signifies much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she  said to herself; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the  trial one way up as the other.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being  upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to  them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the  accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do  anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the  court.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you know about this business?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King said to Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNothing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNothing _whatever?_Ã¢\\x80\\x9d persisted the King.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNothing whatever,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very important,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King said, turning to the jury. They were  just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White  Rabbit interrupted: Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he  said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as  he spoke.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_Un_important, of course, I meant,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King hastily said, and went on  to himself in an undertone,    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cimportantÃ¢\\x80\\x94unimportantÃ¢\\x80\\x94unimportantÃ¢\\x80\\x94importantÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d as if he were trying  which word sounded best.    Some of the jury wrote it down Ã¢\\x80\\x9cimportant,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and some Ã¢\\x80\\x9cunimportant.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut it doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t matter a bit,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought to herself.    At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in  his note-book, cackled out Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSilence!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and read out from his book, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRule  Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Everybody looked at Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m_ not a mile high,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNearly two miles high,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added the Queen.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go, at any rate,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbesides, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not a  regular rule: you invented it just now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the oldest rule in the book,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen it ought to be Number One,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cConsider your  verdict,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the  White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthis paper has just been  picked up.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s in it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t opened it yet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the White Rabbit, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut it seems to be a  letter, written by the prisoner toÃ¢\\x80\\x94to somebody.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt must have been that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cunless it was written to  nobody, which isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t usual, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho is it directed to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said one of the jurymen.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t directed at all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the White Rabbit; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin fact, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  nothing written on the _outside_.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He unfolded the paper as he spoke,  and added Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a letter, after all: itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a set of verses.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAre they in the prisonerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s handwriting?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked another of the jurymen.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the White Rabbit, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the queerest  thing about it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (The jury all looked puzzled.)    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe must have imitated somebody elseÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hand,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King. (The jury  all brightened up again.)    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPlease your Majesty,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Knave, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t write it, and they  canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t prove I did: thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no name signed at the end.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t sign it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat only makes the matter  worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d have signed  your name like an honest man.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really  clever thing the King had said that day.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat _proves_ his guilt,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt proves nothing of the sort!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t even know  what theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re about!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRead them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King.    The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhere shall I begin, please  your Majesty?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBegin at the beginning,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King said gravely, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand go on till you  come to the end: then stop.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    These were the verses the White Rabbit read:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey told me you had been to her,      And mentioned me to him:  She gave me a good character,      But said I could not swim.    He sent them word I had not gone      (We know it to be true):  If she should push the matter on,      What would become of you?    I gave her one, they gave him two,      You gave us three or more;  They all returned from him to you,      Though they were mine before.    If I or she should chance to be      Involved in this affair,  He trusts to you to set them free,      Exactly as we were.    My notion was that you had been      (Before she had this fit)  An obstacle that came between      Him, and ourselves, and it.    DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t let him know she liked them best,      For this must ever be  A secret, kept from all the rest,      Between yourself and me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d      Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the most important piece of evidence weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve heard yet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the  King, rubbing his hands; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cso now let the juryÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf any one of them can explain it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, (she had grown so  large in the last few minutes that she wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a bit afraid of  interrupting him,) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll give him sixpence. _I_ donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  an atom of meaning in it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    The jury all wrote down on their slates, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c_She_ doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  an atom of meaning in it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but none of them attempted to explain the  paper.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no meaning in it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat saves a world of  trouble, you know, as we neednÃ¢\\x80\\x99t try to find any. And yet I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t  know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at  them with one eye; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI seem to see some meaning in them, after all.  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x94_said I could not swim_Ã¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d you canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t swim, can you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, turning  to the Knave.    The Knave shook his head sadly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo I look like it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. (Which he  certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAll right, so far,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King, and he went on muttering over the  verses to himself: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x98_We know it to be true_Ã¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x99 thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the jury, of  courseÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x98_I gave her one, they gave him two_Ã¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x99 why, that must be what he  did with the tarts, you knowÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut, it goes on Ã¢\\x80\\x98_they all returned from him to you_,Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, there they are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King triumphantly, pointing to the  tarts on the table. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNothing can be clearer than _that_. Then  againÃ¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x98_before she had this fit_Ã¢\\x80\\x94Ã¢\\x80\\x99 you never had fits, my dear, I  think?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said to the Queen.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNever!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard  as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his  slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily  began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long  as it lasted.)    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen the words donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t _fit_ you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the King, looking round the  court with a smile. There was a dead silence.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a pun!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King added in an offended tone, and everybody  laughed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet the jury consider their verdict,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the King said, for  about the twentieth time that day.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSentence firstÃ¢\\x80\\x94verdict afterwards.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cStuff and nonsense!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice loudly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe idea of having the  sentence first!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHold your tongue!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Queen, turning purple.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOff with her head!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody  moved.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho cares for you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by  this time.) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re nothing but a pack of cards!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon  her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and  tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her  head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead  leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWake up, Alice dear!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said her sister; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, what a long sleep youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve  had!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve had such a curious dream!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Alice, and she told her  sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she  had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt _was_ a curious  dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s getting late.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,  what a wonderful dream it had been.      But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her  hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all  her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,  and this was her dream:Ã¢\\x80\\x94    First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny  hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were  looking up into hersÃ¢\\x80\\x94she could hear the very tones of her voice, and  see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair  that _would_ always get into her eyesÃ¢\\x80\\x94and still as she listened, or  seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the  strange creatures of her little sisterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s dream.    The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried byÃ¢\\x80\\x94the  frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolÃ¢\\x80\\x94she  could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends  shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen  ordering off her unfortunate guests to executionÃ¢\\x80\\x94once more the pig-baby  was sneezing on the DuchessÃ¢\\x80\\x99s knee, while plates and dishes crashed  around itÃ¢\\x80\\x94once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the  LizardÃ¢\\x80\\x99s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock  Turtle.    So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all  would change to dull realityÃ¢\\x80\\x94the grass would be only rustling in the  wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsÃ¢\\x80\\x94the rattling  teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the QueenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s shrill  cries to the voice of the shepherd boyÃ¢\\x80\\x94and the sneeze of the baby, the  shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change  (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yardÃ¢\\x80\\x94while the  lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock  TurtleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s heavy sobs.    Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers  would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would  keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her  childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,  and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,  perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she  would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all  their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer  days.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm    Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of  electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of  computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It  exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations  from people in all walks of life.    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the  assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s  goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will  remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure  and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future  generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see  Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at  www.gutenberg.org    Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation    The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit  501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the  state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal  Revenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification  number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by  U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.    The Foundation\\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,  Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up  to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s website  and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact    Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg  Literary Archive Foundation    Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without  widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be  freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest  array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt  status with the IRS.    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United  States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up  with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND  DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular  state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who  approach us with offers to donate.    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from  outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.    Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation  methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To  donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate    Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works    Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project  Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be  freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and  distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of  volunteer support.    Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed  editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in  the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not  necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper  edition.    Most people start at our website which has the main PG search  facility: www.gutenberg.org    This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,  including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to  subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
